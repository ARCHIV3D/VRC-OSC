# VRC-OSC

Dynamically loaded cross-platform VRChat OSC plugins written in Rust.

## Plugins:

- [`plugin-clock`](/plugin-clock): Sends the time via avatar parameters for watch prefabs.
- [`plugin-debug`](/plugin-debug): Log all received OSC packets to stdout for debugging.
- [`plugin-lastfm`](/plugin-lastfm): Displays the currently playing song via chatbox.
- [`plugin-spotify`](/plugin-spotify): Displays the currently playing song via chatbox, and controls playback via avatar parameters.
- [`plugin-steamvr`](/plugin-steamvr): Registers VRC-OSC as a SteamVR addon for auto-start/stop.

## Planned:

- [`plugin-controls`](/plugin-controls): Controls media playback via avatar parameters.

## Configuration Documentation:

This is the default configuration file generated at first-run with additional comments for documentation,  
You may copy this as a default configuration, but comments will be wiped on first write.

```toml
# Every plugin has it's own configuration section.

# The built-in plugin loader handles starting every plugin and relaying OSC packets.
# If you're running this on the same computer as VRChat, you won't need to change this.
# If you're using a different PC or Quest you can change the addresses below.
# To receive incoming OSC packets you will need to set the launch option below.
# https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/osc-overview#vrchat-ports
